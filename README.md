# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

## Objective
The objective behind this project is to create a server for the WTWR application. The focus of this phase is on setting up an Express project, creating a MongoDB database, connecting it to the server, configuring the first routes and controllers, and handling errors. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- Express.js: The web framework for building the API with Node.js.
- MongoDB: The NoSQL database used to store user and clothing item data.
- Mongoose: The library that bridges the Node.js application and the MongoDB database.
